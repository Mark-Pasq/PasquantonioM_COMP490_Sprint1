# PasquantonioM_COMP490_Sprint1
# Sprint 1 for Senior Design and Dev (Comp490) Bridgewater State University Spring 2020

# Sprint 1 consists of the setting up and retrieving of the github.com/jobs api.  It had to be converted to
# a .json file so it could be saved to a text file for use later.  There also had to be two tests written 
# to confirm that the file was being downloaded and saved to the text file.  The Sprint 1 files will be used 
# in the Sprint 2 iteration of the project.
